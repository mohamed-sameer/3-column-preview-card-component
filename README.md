## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

there is trick i learned today which is pushing the button link to the very end of the card

if you use flexbox on the container ypu can push the last element to the very end of the container by using this css property (in my case)`margin-top: auto`

### Continued development

i'll continue using css grid alongside with flexbox in the next challenges
